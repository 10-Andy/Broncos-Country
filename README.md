### **Stucture and Skeleton**
This website will have a sigle page structure, due to its easier flow. The website will have a navigation bar and a minimum of 4 sections linked to it.

For the base of this structure ive used __Bootstrap__, it will provide numerous elements on the page from the responsive design to the buttons and nav bar.

<a></a>
* #### **Wireframes**
    For my Wireframes ive used __Balsamiq__.I've created 3 Wireframe to show desktop, tablet and mobile 

    links bellow 

    * #### [**__Desktop Wireframe__**]()
    * #### [**__Tablet Wireframe__**]()
    * #### [**__Mobile Wireframe__**]()

    <a></a>
### **Surface**
As the Denver Broncos are a sports team, I've made my design choices based on their color scheme, and images of players and the stadium.

<a></a>
* #### **Fonts**
    I've used __Google Fonts__ to find an apporiate font for this project. For my heading I've used _____ , 

    For my content I've used ______. I've used these fonts to stand out  and compliment one another.

<a></a>
* #### **Icons**
    The icons I've utilized in the project are from __Font Awesome__. The main icon used is to turn the nav bar into an american football on mobile devices.

<a></a>
* #### **Colors**
    Ive based my color scheme on the teams main     colors.
    I've researched and found on __Code of colors__ the RGBA color codes so I can implement them in my project.

<a></a>
## **Features**

<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

*   #### **Hero Image**

     I have used a full width hero image at the top of the page, this will be an aerial view of the team stadium. This will also have the name of the website over the image.

*   #### **Navigation**

     I've used __Bootstraps Javascript__ to implement a responsive navbar, on mobile device it will have an american football icon. It will have the navbar fixed to the top of the page and include 5 links to allow easy navigation.

*    #### **Welcome Section**

     This displays the teams logo surrounded by 4 short paragraphs, these will have 4 facts about the teams history. Two paragraphs will be hidden on mobile for design purposes.

*    #### **Superbowl Wins**
     I've used __Bootstraps__ grid to add 3 pictures of the Superbowls the team have won, these will have the score and a short write up underneath. For mobile devices the images will be displayed on the left with the paragraphs on the right.

*    #### **Players To Watch**
     Again with the help of  __Bootstrap__ I've used two player head shots one left and one right with a write up underneath, on mobile devices these will be displayed side by side, the same as the Superbowl wins.

*    #### **Season Opponents**
     I've used __Bootstraps__ grid to display both home and away opponents seperated by a verticle line, images will be used for each team. On mobile devices the verticle line will be lost and the home will be above the away teams separated by a horizontal rule.

*    #### **Sign Up Form**
     Here I've included the link to the relevent social media sites and the sign up for the weekly newsletter.
     After the user fills out the form and hits the sign up button, feedback will be given in the form of a pop up modal.
