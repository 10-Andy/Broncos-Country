### **Stucture and Skeleton**
This website will have a sigle page structure, due to its easier flow. The website will have a navigation bar and a minimum of 4 sections linked to it.

For the base of this structure ive used __Bootstrap__, it will provide numerous elements on the page from the responsive design to the buttons and nav bar.

<a></a>

    For my Wireframes ive used __Balsamiq__.I've created 3 Wireframe to show desktop, tablet and mobile 

    links bellow

    * #### [**__Tablet Wireframe__**](wireframes/Broncos-Country-tablet.png)
    * #### [**__Mobile Wireframe__**](wireframes/Broncos-Country-Mobile.png)

    <a></a>
### **Surface**
As the Denver Broncos are a sports team, I've made my design choices based on their color scheme, and images of players and the stadium.

<a></a>
* #### **Fonts**
    I've used __Google Fonts__ to find an apporiate font for this project. For my heading I've used Ubuntu , 

    For my content I've used Oxygen. I've used these fonts to stand out  and compliment one another.

<a></a>
* #### **Icons**
    The icons I've utilized in the project are from __Font Awesome__. The main icon used is to turn the nav bar into an american football on mobile devices.

<a></a>
* #### **Colors**
    Ive based my color scheme on the teams main colors.
    I've researched and found on [Code of colors](https://www.codeofcolors.com/denver-broncos-colors.html) the RGBA color codes so I can implement them in my project.

## **Features**

<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

*   #### **Hero Image**

     I have used a full width hero image at the top of the page, this will be an aerial view of the team stadium. This will also have the name of the website over the image.

*   #### **Navigation**

     I've used __Bootstraps Javascript__ to implement a responsive navbar, on mobile device it will have an american football icon. It will have the navbar fixed to the top of the page and include 5 links to allow easy navigation.

*    #### **Welcome Section**

     This displays the teams old logo 1 short paragraphs, these will have 3 fact sections about the teams history. One facts section  will be hidden on mobile for design purposes.

*    #### **Superbowl Wins**
     I've used __Bootstraps__ grid to add 3 pictures of the Superbowls the team have won, these will have the score and a short write up underneath. For mobile devices the images will be displayed on the left with the paragraphs on the right.

*    #### **Players To Watch**
     Again with the help of  __Bootstrap__ I've used two player head shots one left and one right with a write up underneath, on mobile devices these will be displayed side by side, the same as the Superbowl wins.

*    #### **Season Opponents**
     I've used __Bootstraps__ grid to display both home and away opponents seperated by a verticle line, images will be used for each team. On mobile devices the verticle line will be lost and the home will be above the away teams separated by a horizontal rule.

*    #### **Sign Up Form**
     Here I've included the link to the relevent social media sites and the sign up for the weekly newsletter.
     After the user fills out the form and hits the sign up button, feedback will be given in the form of a pop up modal.

## **Testing**

  ### **Nav Bar**

* #### **Plan** 
    I wanted a navigation bar that is fixed to the top of the page, with 6 clickable links, that was clear and easy to use, one being an image of the Denver Broncos logo. When clicked, the links with help you navagate through the page with ease. On mobile and some tablet devices I wanted the navbar to be collapsable using an american football icon.
    
        
* #### **Implementation** 
    I used bootstrap to implement my nav bar. This allowed for easy design and structure. I used Font Awsome for the icon. I also used my own css to overide the bootstrap css to make the nav bar fit in with the overall design.

* #### **Testing**
    To test the nav bar I clicked on all the links to make sure they worked as they should on both desktop and mobile views. Also checking does the nav bar collapse and the football icon appear on smaller devices.


* #### **Result**
    The links worked as they should on all devices, the nav bar collapsed and the football icon appeared.
    The nav bar didn't close after I clicked a link on mobile/tablet.

* #### **Result** 
    Most tests passed except the issue of the nav bar not closing after a link had been clicked, I found a piece of JavaScript on [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to solve this issue.

### **2021 Opponents**

* #### **Plan** 
    I wanted images of the 2021 opponents logos within a cirlce in two sections, home and away, divided by a vertical line. When viewed on small devices the home section would be above the away section with a horizontal line dividing them.

* #### **Implementation** 
    Ive used bootstraps grid to help structure the teams logos, while using media queries to change the divding line from horizontal to vertical. I used css to style the images.


* #### **Testing**
    I viewed the 2021 opponents section on different browsers and devices. The images in the section worked as they should with the dividing line changing as it should.

* #### **Result**
    The section worked as planned.

### **Modal**

* #### **Plan** 
    I wanted a modal to provide feeback on the Broncos Country weekly email sign up form when the user completed it correctly.

* #### **Implementation** 
    I've used bootstrap for the modal and used css to overide bootstraps css styling. I added an image of the Denver Broncos logo and text to show feedback to the user.

* #### **Testing**
    The modal preformed as it should but I found you could click the sign up button withput filling in the form and the modal would show as if you completed the from, I needed  help from my mentor who wrote a piece of JavaScript to fix the issue.

* #### **Result**
    The modal worked as planned.
