        <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers, 24–10. The game was played on February 7,
            2016, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The NFL Dropped the
            traditional
            use of Roman numerals as it was the 50th SuperBowl game, so the logo could prominently feature the number
            50, the golden anniversary.
            Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP.This game was also the final game of Peyton Manning's
            career;
            the Broncos quarterback, who also won Super Bowl XLI, announced his retirement in March 2016. </p>

    <!--Players to watch-->
    <div>

        <h3>Von Miller #58 OLB</h3>
        <p>The Super Bowl 50 MVP has been with the organization throughout his
            decade-long career and has proven to be one of the better pass-rushers of his era,
            being a unanimous selection to the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 2010s.
            The 31-year-old missed the entire 2020 season due to a tendon injury he suffered in his ankle back in early
            September
            just prior to the start of the regular season. Denver went 5-11 in Miller's absence.
            Miller will be paid $7 million guaranteed and an $18 million salary for the coming season as the Broncos
            elect to take up his fifth year option.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Jerry Jeudy #10 WR</h3>
    <p>The second year prospect had an impressive rookie season, with 52 receptions, 856 receving yards and 3
        touchdowns.
        Whats most impressive about Jeudy is his exceptional route running skills and his seperation at the line.
        He has been plagued with drops in his rookie season 12 in total tied 2nd most in the NFL.
        The Alabama Crimson Tide alumni has all the skills needed to excell in the 2021 season.
        Hes coming in with a chip on his shoulder with something to prove and is definitely one to watch.
