                    <h3 class="text-center"> Jerry Jeudy #10 WR</h3>
                    <p>The second year prospect had an impressive rookie season, with 52 receptions, 856 receving yards
                        and
                        3
                        touchdowns.
                        Whats most impressive about Jeudy is his exceptional route running skills and his seperation at
                        the
                        line.
                        He has been plagued with drops in his rookie season 12 in total tied 2nd most in the NFL.
                        The Alabama Crimson Tide alumni has all the skills needed to excell in the 2021 season.
                        Hes coming in with a chip on his shoulder with something to prove and is definitely one to
                        watch.
