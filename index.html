                            decade-long career and has proven to be one of the better pass-rushers of his era,
                            being a unanimous selection to the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 2010s.
                            The 31-year-old missed the entire 2020 season due to a tendon injury he suffered in his
                            ankle
                            back
                            in early
                            September
                            just prior to the start of the regular season. Denver went 5-11 in Miller's absence.
                            Miller will be paid $7 million guaranteed and an $18 million salary for the coming season as
                            the
                            Broncos
                            elect to take up his fifth year option.
